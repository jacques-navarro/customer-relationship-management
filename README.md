### Objective:
To develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using Spring Boot.

### Scenario:
You have been hired to create a CRM system for a small business. The system will help the business manage customer interactions, track sales, and analyze customer data efficiently.

### Instructions:

1.	Set up a new Spring Boot project:
    - Create a new Spring Boot project.
    - Include the necessary dependencies.
  
2.	Define data models for customers and sales:
    - Create Java classes to represent the customer and sales entities.
    - Define attributes such as name, email, phone number, address for the customer entity, and attributes such as product name, quantity sold, transaction date for the sales entity.
    - Annotate the classes with JPA annotations to map them to the database tables.
  
3.	Configure database connection properties:
    - Configure database connection properties in the application.properties.

4.	Create repositories for CRUD operations:
    - Create repository interfaces for the customer and sales entities to perform CRUD operations.

5.	Implement services for business logic:
    -	Create the service classes.
    -	Implement methods to interact with the repository layer for CRUD operations and business-specific operations.

6.	Create RESTful API endpoints:
    -	Define controller classes to handle HTTP requests and responses.
    -	Create endpoints.

7.	Implement request validation and error handling:
    -	Validate request parameters.
    -	Implement error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of failures.

8.	Test the application using Postman:
    - Use Postman to send requests to the API endpoints and verify the functionality.
    - Test different scenarios such as creating customers, updating sales transactions, and handling validation errors.

9.	Optional: Add features like analytics or authentication:
    - Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints.
